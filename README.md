# Scooter-Rental

In this project, the goal was to predict the number of scooter rental users to help demand forecasting. As this was a regression problem, we trained and evaluated the performance of the following models:

__Linear Models__
* Linear Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Ridge Regression

__Ensemble Models__
* Random Forest Regression
* Gradient Boosting Regression

These models were chosen as they allow us to compare the performance between Linear Regression, Bootstrap Aggregation (Random Forest) and Boosting algorithms.
